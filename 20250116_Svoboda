**Title**：Science at the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics (AIND)

**Abstract**:  Our goal is to discover how the brain produces out emotions, memories, and actions. Answers will be in terms of neural activity in defined neuron types interacting across the whole brain and body. To advance our goals we are developing next-generation neurotechnologies. We are also committed to Open Science: Knowledge, data, and tools will be widely shared, to facilitate science elsewhere and to support the development of therapies for brain disorders. I will describe how AIND scientists and engineers organize for team science. I will then discuss a few recent neurotechnological and scientific advances.
