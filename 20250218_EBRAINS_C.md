Firstly, we will describe the architecture of the EBRAINS-RI, taking you on a virtual tour of the components that enable integrated and interoperable scientific workflows. Secondly, we will outline our education and training strategy, including upcoming events and resources aimed at supporting the growth and development of the next generation of brain scientists.
