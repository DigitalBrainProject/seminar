                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the brain requires linking microscopic biophysical
                        properties (e.g., ion channel dynamics and dendritic morphology) to emergent macroscopic
                        phenomena (e.g., neural oscillations and network dynamics). While biologically detailed models
                        are instrumental for this mechanistic insight, their inherent computational cost is substantial.
                        While conventional simulators like NEURON and Arbor are highly effective for general use, in
                        simulating models at the extreme scale, they could become inefficient. This is primarily in
                        terms of their scalability and optimization to fully leverage modern High-Performance Computing
                        (HPC) architectures.</p>

                    <p>We introduce Neulite (<a href="https://numericalbrain.org/neulite/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">https://numericalbrain.org/neulite/</a>), a light-weight
                        biophysically detailed neural circuit simulator. It is architecturally defined by two core
                        components: a frontend compliant with the Allen Institute’s Brain Modeling ToolKit (BMTK), and a
                        portable numerical kernel. The frontend facilitates biological plausibility and reproducibility
                        through the utilization of standardized data. The kernel, which can be specifically tuned for
                        different computing architectures, allows us to overcome the limitations of conventional
                        simulators through optimized, domain-specific algorithms.</p>

                    <p>Neulite has been utilized to successfully execute the Allen Institute’s whole mouse cortex model
                        on the Supercomputer Fugaku. We used the entire Fugaku system to simulate 9 million biologically
                        detailed neurons and 26 billion synapses, demonstrating a significant scale of computation. This
                        work is the result of an international collaboration with the team of Dr. Anton Arkhipov at the
                        Allen Institute, where their comprehensive model met our high-performance simulation technology,
                        with support from key domestic contributors (RIKEN R-CCS, RIST, and Yamaguchi University).
                        Neulite is therefore a valuable tool for achieving data-driven, large-scale modeling and
                        advancing the understanding of how cellular properties influence overall neural circuit
                        function.</p>

                        genetically organized remains one of the fundamental challenges in neuroscience. Roger Sperry's
                        classical chemoaffinity theory proposed that molecular gradients provide positional cues for
                        axonal wiring, yet its application has been largely limited to localized sensory systems. Here,
                        we introduce SPERRFY (Spatial Positional Encoding for Reconstructing Rules of axonal Fiber
                        connectivitY), a data-driven framework to examine whether Sperry's concept can be generalized to
                        the entire brain. By integrating mesoscale connectomic data with spatial transcriptomic maps
                        from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, SPERRFY applies canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to
                        identify latent correlated structures between gene-expression and connectivity spaces, thereby
                        inferring positional gradients that may reflect molecular constraints underlying long-range
                        axonal organization. This framework bridges molecular and anatomical levels of organization,
                        providing a quantitative basis for reinterpreting Sperry's chemoaffinity theory in the context
                        of whole-brain connectomics.</p>

                        challenges, we anticipate the roles that each team member will play, consider our own role based
                        on these predictions, and adjust our behaviour accordingly. Because each member differs in
                        experience and skills, it is necessary to flexibly adapt the strategy used for prediction. For
                        example, when interacting with beginners who have less career experience, we can make reasonable
                        predictions about their performance by projecting adjusting introspection ('social
                        metacognition'). In contrast, the same strategy cannot be applied to experts with more extensive
                        experience. In this talk, I will introduce our latest research addressing this issue.
                        Specifically, we found that the anterior lateral prefrontal cortex (area 47) is engaged when
                        predicting the thoughts of beginners through social metacognition, whereas the temporoparietal
                        junction (TPJ) is recruited when predicting the thoughts of experts based on heuristics. The
                        lecture will begin with an overview of the foundations of metacognition and then present the
                        studies that led to these findings.</p>

                        structure of the brain determines its activity and function. To explore this systematically, we
                        develop large-scale bio-realistic simulations of brain circuits, which integrate a broad array
                        of experimental data: Distribution and morpho-electric properties of different neuron types;
                        Connection probabilities, synaptic weights, axonal delays, and dendritic targeting rules; And a
                        representation of inputs into the simulated circuits from other parts of the brain. We will
                        discuss this approach focusing on the 230,000-neuron model of mouse primary visual cortex (area
                        V1). Simulations of neural activity in the model match experimental recordings in vivo on a
                        number of metrics, such as firing rates, direction selectivity, and others. Applications include
                        the following problems of broad interest: Understanding how architecture of brain circuit gives
                        rise to the observed functional activity; Learning of behavioral and computational tasks in
                        biological and artificial networks; Generation of the extracellular electric potential due to
                        synaptic activity in the cortex. The model is shared freely with the community via
                        brain-map.org, as are the datasets it is based on.</p>

                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Factor analysis is a statistical method for
                        identifying latent factors from the correlation structures of high-dimensional data. It was
                        originally developed for applications in social and behavioral sciences but has since been
                        applied to various research fields, including the natural sciences. An advantage of factor
                        analysis is that it leads to interpretable latent factors, enabling applications such as the
                        identification of active brain regions in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a penalized
                        maximum likelihood estimation method aimed at enhancing the interpretability of latent factors.
                        In particular, the Prenet (Product-based elastic net) penalization allows for the estimation of
                        a perfect simple structure, a desirable characteristic in the factor analysis literature. The
                        usefulness of the proposed method is investigated through real data analyses. Finally, we
                        discuss potential extensions and applications of the proposed method in neuroscience.</p>

                        <p class="abstract" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">NEST [2] is a powerful simulation engine that
                            has evolved with the neuroscience community over a quarter-century. The simulator has been
                            continuously advanced and extended to tackle new scientific questions and to push the
                            boundaries of large-scale brain simulation at the resolution of single neurons and synapses.
                            The code is extremely scalable, where recent technological advancements also target
                            GPU-based systems [3]. The graphical frontend NEST Desktop [4] and the modelling language
                            NESTML [5] make the NEST ecosystem easily accessible to new users.</p>
                        <p class="abstract" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The NEST ecosystem is open source and developed
                            under the umbrella of the NEST Initiative [1]. This community organization promotes the use
                            of standard high-quality tools in neuroscience and related fields such as artificial
                            intelligence and neurorobotics, thus fostering sustainable research. In the EBRAINS research
                            infrastructure, NEST provides key functionality for research into the dynamics, structure,
                            and function of brain-scale spiking networks [6].</p>

                            resolution is a challenge still far out of the reach of computational neuroscience. Neural
                            mass models, as implemented in The Virtual Brain (TVB) [^tvb], capture whole brain dynamics
                            with a coarse or fine grid at the brain area level and have made personalized medicine and
                            clinical interventions feasible [^tvb-epilepsy]. At the other end of the spectrum,
                            computational tools like Arbor [^arb] enable us to model neurons with full morphological
                            details but with only fractions of the required counts of neurons and synapses. In this
                            study, we present an attempt to combine TVB and Arbor in a practical approach ---
                            simultaneously simulating a given brain region at the microscopic level and neural mass
                            models to provide a salient approximation of the neural activity of the remaining brain
                            areas. We build a scalable co-simulation workflow by leveraging the interfaces provided by
                            both Arbor and TVB to communicate with other external simulators. The resulting framework is
                            flexible as it employs existing models available in both simulators respectively with only
                            minor changes. Additionally, synaptic connections bridging models between TVB and Arbor are
                            specified. This feature allows for swapping dynamics on a per-region (TVB) or per-cell
                            (Arbor) basis without redefining the workflow. Thus, different parts of the brain can be
                            modeled and simulated in detail without sweeping changes to the overall model. We show here
                            some preliminary applications of this Arbor-TVB framework and workflow to simulate the
                            dynamics of seizure propagation.</p>

                        Understanding the developmental mechanisms that underlie brain functions is a fundamental
                        question in neuroscience, with significant implications for research on artificial neural
                        networks. This talk will introduce principles related to these developmental mechanisms, which
                        differ notably from the data-driven learning paradigms predominantly used in AI. I will present
                        our recent findings demonstrating that early functional circuits and cognitive functions in the
                        brain can emerge spontaneously, even in the complete absence of training. Using a biologically
                        inspired neural network model, I will first show how regularly structured functional maps can
                        arise from simple local interactions between individual cells. I will discuss how evolutionary
                        variations in physical parameters may lead to the development of distinct functional circuitry
                        in the brain. Next, I will demonstrate that higher cognitive functions, such as visual quantity
                        estimation and primitive object detection, can also emerge spontaneously in untrained neural
                        networks. I will argue that random feedforward connections in early circuits may be sufficient
                        to initiate functional circuits. These findings suggest that early visual functions can emerge
                        from the statistical properties of bottom-up projections in hierarchical neural networks,
                        providing insight into the origins of primitive functions in the brain.</p>

                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the past twenty years, we have made significant
                        progress in creating digital models of an individual’s brain, so called virtual brain twins. By
                        combining brain imaging data with mathematical models, we can predict outcomes more accurately
                        than using each method separately. Our approach has helped us understand normal brain states,
                        their operation and conditions like healthy aging, dementia and epilepsy. Using a combination of
                        computational modeling and dynamical systems analysis we provide a mechanistic description of
                        the formation of resting state manifold via the network connectivity. We demonstrate that the
                        symmetry breaking by the connectivity creates a characteristic flow on the manifold, which
                        produces the major data features across scales and imaging modalities. These include spontaneous
                        high amplitude co-activations, neuronal cascades, spectral cortical gradients, multistability,
                        and characteristic functional connectivity dynamics. When aggregated across cortical
                        hierarchies, these match the profiles from empirical data and explain features of the brain’s
                        microstate organization. The digital brain twin augments the value of empirical data by
                        completing missing data, allowing clinical hypothesis testing and optimizing treatment
                        strategies for the individual patient. Virtual Brain Twins are part of the European
                        infrastructure called EBRAINS, which supports researchers worldwide in digital neuroscience.</p>

                        <p class="abstract">Data sharing in human neuroimaging remains a critical component of many
                            research projects, in particular when machine learning models for predicting diagnosis or
                            disease progression need to be fitted or tested on data from different cohorts. Data sharing
                            remains very hard for clinical researchers who i) don't always have the technical resources
                            ii) face ethical and legal barriers iii) have institutional incentives to keep the data
                            local. We propose a change in paradigm in neuroimaging datasharing. Current solutions are
                            often centralized and need complex data sharing research agreements and adaptation to legal
                            frameworks, for instance the GDPR in Europe. We present Neurobagel, a distributed data
                            sharing solution based on neuroimaging and clinical standards, that enable search of
                            participant data across the world. Our current implementation already has more than 8 nodes
                            and 30,000 participant data (healthy or patients).</p>

                    <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Empirical applications of the free-energy principle
                        at the cellular and synaptic levels are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to
                        a particular process theory (i.e., neuronal basis). To address this issue, we developed a
                        reverse engineering technique that links quantities in neuronal networks to those in Bayesian
                        inference and showed that any canonical neural network—whose activity and plasticity minimise a
                        shared Helmholtz energy—can be cast as performing variational Bayesian inference. By combining
                        with an in vitro causal inference paradigm, we experimentally validated the free-energy
                        principle by showing its ability to predict the quantitative self-organisation of in vitro
                        neural networks. We have recently begun to apply this technique to neural activity of zebrafish
                        and rodents to reverse engineer their generative models. The virtues of the reverse engineering
                        are that, when provided with initial empirical data, it enables the systematic identification of
                        a generative model employed by the biological system. The reconstructed generative model yields
                        a neuromorphic artificial intelligence that performs Bayesian inference. This further enables
                        the quantitative predictions of subsequent self-organisation and learning in the system.</p>

                        survive. These machines treat information in the digital world but interact with humans in the
                        physical world. To bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms, we have dedicated our
                        efforts to the creation of new AI-based 3D vision models. Our research has been centered on the
                        task of capturing and modeling the human body, as this is fundamental for enhancing
                        human-machine interactions. Leveraging generative AI, which learns from vast collections of
                        images and videos, we have been able to gain insights into human body shapes, deformations, and
                        semantic interactions within various scenes. This research represents a significant step toward
                        the development of Large 3D Vision Models, which are essential for advancing machines toward
                        greater autonomy and intelligence. In this talk, I will present the latest innovations in the
                        creation of digital and autonomous human avatars, showcasing how these advancements are shaping

                            hidden principled structures behind observations</p>
                        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in AI have utilized extensive
                            data sets to train models capable of understanding and generating observations across
                            various modalities. Notably, Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures
                            excel in natural language processing, often outperforming the average human. This success
                            demonstrates AI's ability to grasp the complex structures underlying human language.
                            However, a significant challenge remains: AI models do not possess a clear method to
                            communicate the "generalizable structures"—the underlying patterns and principles—they
                            learned from data. Unlike humans, who can innovate language through the creation of new
                            terms and grammatical rules—as exemplified by the development of mathematical languages to
                            elegantly describe physical phenomena, AI lacks a mechanism to explicitly reveal the
                            structures and principles they have learned. The core issue stems from AI's inability to
                            "invent" their own languages or to recognize and express the implicit structures acquired
                            through training. By developing AI systems capable of not only learning from data but also
                            articulating and refining the implicitly learned structures, we would mark a significant
                            leap towards machines that can think, learn, and create in ways more akin to human
                            cognition. In this talk, I will present our recent work aiming at enabling machines to
                            explicitly learn the hidden principled mechanisms behind real-world observations, such as
                            disentangled and equivariant structures. Additionally, I will discuss an ongoing project
                            focusing on neural synchrony-based object discovery, inspired by the temporal coding
                            hypothesis in neuroscience.</p>

                            the next project, nicknamed Brain/MINDS 2.0, is starting this year. A remarkable feature of
                            this new project is that the "digital brain” plays a central role in integrating brain data
                            at multiple scales from multiple species and for understanding the brain functions and
                            neuropsychiatric disorders. But what exactly is the digital brain? As project’s core
                            organization member in charge of the digital brain development, I will present what is the
                            current design of the digital brain, what kind of data, technologies, and infrastructures
                            are require, and what outcomes are expected. A call for specific research proposals is now
                            open till April 10th (<a href="https://www.amed.go.jp/koubo/15/01/1501B_00104.html"
